<img src="/mvp-db-design.png" alt="Db design" />


Why I built this project -

1. To have handson experience in using a RDBMS
2. Learn about testing and how to implement it
   in a relatively large project
3. To develop my "engineering" skills on
   a whole like api and db designing fundamentals.

Project Description :
Tech Stack - MySql Expressjs Reactjs Nodejs

Main 3rd Party Libraries & Services -

1. Passportjs and validatejs for user authentication
2. Multer for efficient file upload
3. Cloudinary as cdn when file is uploaded
4. AWS for cloud hosting

Challenges I faced - ...
Basic Features -
User Authentication & profile setup - users should be authenticated and then prompted to create a profile
User post - users should be able to make a post that can be liked by and commented on by other users
User follow - users should be able to follow one another
User follow reccomendation - user will be recommended to follow users that are in a relatively close proximity, like country, state, city etc.
